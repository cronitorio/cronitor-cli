### Uninstall CronitorCLI
First, you will need to update any crontab files that were edited to include Cronitor to remove the reference to `cronitor exec MONITOR_KEY` that were added when you created monitors.

Then, remove the cronitor executable from wherever it was installed. If you followed our default instructions it can be removed with `rm /usr/bin/cronitor`
