# Cronitor Dashboard Security Plan

## Overview
The Cronitor dashboard provides a web interface for managing cron jobs and monitors. Due to its ability to execute commands and manage system processes, it requires careful security considerations to prevent unauthorized access and potential privilege escalation.

## Current Security Features
- Basic authentication using username/password
- Configurable credentials via environment variables
- Embedded static file serving

## Security Concerns

### 1. Authentication & Access Control
#### Current State
- Basic authentication is implemented
- No rate limiting on authentication attempts
- No session management
- No CSRF protection
- No IP-based access restrictions

#### Proposed Improvements
- Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
  - Problem: Prevents brute force attacks by limiting failed login attempts
  - Implementation: Use golang.org/x/time/rate package to implement a token bucket rate limiter, storing attempt counts in memory with a 5-minute window

- Add session management with secure session tokens
  - Problem: Current stateless auth allows token reuse and doesn't support session invalidation
  - Implementation: Implement JWT-based sessions with short expiration times, refresh tokens, and server-side session tracking

- Add CSRF protection for all POST/PUT/DELETE requests
  - Problem: Current implementation vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks
  - Implementation: Add CSRF tokens to all forms and API requests, validate tokens on server side

- Add IP-based access restrictions
  - Problem: No way to restrict access to specific IP ranges
  - Implementation: Add configurable IP whitelist/blacklist with CIDR support, implement middleware to check client IPs

- Add support for TLS/HTTPS
  - Problem: Current implementation allows unencrypted communication
  - Implementation: Add TLS configuration with modern cipher suites, make HTTPS mandatory in production

- Add support for additional authentication methods
  - Problem: Basic auth may not be sufficient for enterprise environments
  - Implementation: Add OAuth2 and LDAP support as optional authentication methods

### 2. Command Execution Security
#### Current State
- No command validation/sanitization
- No command execution timeouts
- No command whitelisting
- No user permission checks
- No logging of command execution

#### Proposed Improvements
- Implement command validation using regex patterns
  - Problem: No validation of commands before execution
  - Implementation: Create regex patterns for allowed commands, validate against patterns before execution

- Add command execution timeouts
  - Problem: Commands can run indefinitely
  - Implementation: Add context with timeout to all command executions, kill processes that exceed timeout

- Create a whitelist of allowed commands
  - Problem: Any command can be executed
  - Implementation: Create configurable whitelist of allowed commands and arguments

- Add user permission checks before execution
  - Problem: No verification of user permissions
  - Implementation: Check user permissions against command requirements before execution

- Implement comprehensive command execution logging
  - Problem: No audit trail of command execution
  - Implementation: Log all command executions with user, command, arguments, and outcome

- Add command output sanitization
  - Problem: Command output may contain sensitive information
  - Implementation: Sanitize command output to remove sensitive data before sending to client

- Add support for command execution in isolated environments
  - Problem: Commands run in same environment as dashboard
  - Implementation: Add support for running commands in containers or isolated environments

### 3. Process Management Security
#### Current State
- No validation of PIDs before killing processes
- No permission checks before killing processes
- No logging of process kills
- No process ownership verification

#### Proposed Improvements
- Add PID validation
  - Problem: No validation of process IDs before killing
  - Implementation: Validate PID format and existence before attempting to kill

- Implement process ownership checks
  - Problem: Can kill processes owned by other users
  - Implementation: Check process ownership before allowing kill operation

- Add permission verification before process termination
  - Problem: No verification of user permissions for process management
  - Implementation: Check user permissions against process requirements

- Add comprehensive process management logging
  - Problem: No audit trail of process management operations
  - Implementation: Log all process management operations with user, action, and outcome

- Add process kill confirmation for critical processes
  - Problem: No confirmation for killing important processes
  - Implementation: Add confirmation step for critical process termination

- Implement process kill rate limiting
  - Problem: No limit on number of processes that can be killed
  - Implementation: Add rate limiting for process kill operations

### 4. File Operations Security
#### Current State
- No validation of file paths
- No permission checks for file operations
- No logging of file operations
- Potential path traversal vulnerabilities

#### Proposed Improvements
- Implement file path validation
  - Problem: No validation of file paths before operations
  - Implementation: Validate and sanitize all file paths, prevent directory traversal

- Add permission checks for file operations
  - Problem: No verification of file permissions
  - Implementation: Check file permissions before read/write operations

- Add comprehensive file operation logging
  - Problem: No audit trail of file operations
  - Implementation: Log all file operations with user, action, and file path

- Implement path traversal protection
  - Problem: Vulnerable to directory traversal attacks
  - Implementation: Sanitize paths and use absolute path resolution

- Add file operation rate limiting
  - Problem: No limit on file operations
  - Implementation: Add rate limiting for file operations

- Implement file access controls
  - Problem: No fine-grained file access control
  - Implementation: Add configurable file access rules

### 5. Network Security
#### Current State
- No TLS/HTTPS enforcement
- No IP-based access restrictions
- No proper CORS configuration
- No request rate limiting

#### Proposed Improvements
- Add TLS/HTTPS support with modern cipher suites
  - Problem: No encryption for network traffic
  - Implementation: Configure TLS with modern cipher suites and proper certificate handling

- Implement IP-based access restrictions
  - Problem: No IP-based access control
  - Implementation: Add configurable IP whitelist/blacklist with CIDR support

- Configure proper CORS policies
